# Recommendation System for Netflix Audience Behavior (UK Movies)

This project implements a movie recommendation system using the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithm. The system takes a user's preferred movie genre as input, identifies the most similar users, and suggests the most-watched movies from those similar users. By using collaborative filtering techniques, this system improves recommendation accuracy, offering a personalized movie list based on shared viewing preferences. The approach leverages user behavior data from the Netflix audience dataset to enhance recommendation quality and user experience.
