# Mental Health Data Analysis with Relational and Graph Databases

## Overview
This project focuses on managing and analyzing mental health data using both relational and graph databases. The dataset includes features such as gender, occupation, stress levels, coping struggles, and mental health history.

## Objectives
1. Build a relational database with **PostgreSQL**:
   - Designed the schema and created the dataset from scratch.
   - Optimized queries for performance and extracted valuable insights.

2. Build a graph database with **Neo4j**:
   - Modeled the same dataset as a graph.
   - Explored relationships and uncovered additional insights.

## Dataset Features
- **Demographic Data**: Gender, Country, Occupation, Self-employed.  
- **Mental Health Indicators**: Family history, Treatment, Days Indoors, Growing Stress, Mental Health History, Mood Swings.  
- **Behavioral Factors**: Changes in Habits, Coping Struggles, Work Interest, Social Weakness.  
- **Miscellaneous**: Care Options, Interview Status, Year, Month, Hour.

## Tools and Technologies
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database schema creation, data insertion, and query optimization.  
- **Neo4j**: Graph modeling, querying relationships, and visualizing mental health trends.

## Results
- Optimized relational queries for data-driven insights.  
- Visualized relationships and patterns in mental health data using graph analysis.  
- Gained a comprehensive understanding of mental health trends through dual database approaches.
